## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

First release. Nothing in this entry is tagged or published yet; the release steps
are in [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).

### Added

- Resumable stage workflow: intent, design, plan, build, test, accept and optional
  release, with side stages for bugs, repeated validation and the librarian;
  checkpoint schema 2 in `.chough/session.json`, focused cases (`chough-testing/1`),
  local bugs, preferences and run consents, and per-host skill installation
  ([#2](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/2)).
- Native archive CI gate: a pull request cannot merge while a native SpecSync change
  is active or an archive fails to authenticate
  ([#3](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/3)); the archive gate now runs
  before every other CI job ([#18](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/18)).
- Fail-closed stage gates on native approval validity, archive integrity and the SDD
  policy ([#7](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/7)).
- Bounded external commands: time and output limits for case bindings and native
  reads; validation honors a stop request after waiting
  ([#8](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/8)).
- Reference-aware evidence retention (`chough evidence prune`), current guidance and
  an installable package that carries no Chough records
  ([#9](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/9)).
- `chough timing`: how long stages, tests, bug fixes and human decisions took, from
  existing records ([#15](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/15)).
- Case binding `env`, matching on visible text with terminal escape sequences removed
  (an `expect_output` fragment containing ESC is refused), and actionable
  requirement and bug errors ([#16](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/16)).
- Release preparation: pinned HI 0.8.0, SpecSync 6.1.1 and Fledge 1.8.0 with one
  install command and a test that keeps the pins in agreement, a minimum Rust
  version of 1.88 checked in CI, skill guidance corrected against the helper, and
  this change log.

### Changed

- Native status is parsed beyond the display bound, and checkpoint clears apply
  before additions ([#4](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/4),
  recorded in [#6](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/6)).
- Evidence stays current across commits that change only Chough records or SpecSync
  bookkeeping, and a bug is verified only by a pass observed after its latest
  failure ([#17](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/17)).
- The skill bundle holds no em or en dashes
  ([#16](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/16)); the README says how to
  pronounce the name ([#19](https://github.com/CorvidLabs/chough/pull/19)).
